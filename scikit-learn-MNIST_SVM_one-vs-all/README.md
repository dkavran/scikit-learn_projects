# scikit-learn-MNIST_SVM_one-vs-all
One-Vs-All multiclass SVM classification of MNIST digit dataset

## About

- 10 binary SVM classificators trained with hyperparameters optimized for distinguishing all 10 digits in MNIST dataset
- Selecting predictions based on highest probability, calculated by individual classificator, for each test case
- Classificators reach around 0.86 F1 score

## Getting Started

To run the code, simply open SVM_classification.ipynb and see results at the bottom. You can also run SVM_classification.py in a python interpreter.
